# The Great Tree-List Recursion Problem

I decided to do this in Go. I did it in C a long time ago.

# Problem Statement

The challenge is to take an ordered binary tree and rearrange the internal
pointers to make a circular doubly linked list out of it. The "small" pointer
should play the role of "previous" and the "large" pointer should play the role
of "next". The list should be arranged so that the nodes are in increasing
order...
